# Disable all checks in this folder.
# Except clang-tidy complains when no checks are enabled, so we do a no-op.
# Newer clang-tidy can use '--allow-no-checks' but CI uses old version
# From https://stackoverflow.com/a/58379342
# The HeaderFileExtensions option can be used to make the check work with only
# certain header file suffixes. If you set it to something non-existent line
# "x" then you have a hello-world-do-nothing-check alternative. Your clang-tidy
# file would then look something like this:
Checks: '-*,misc-definitions-in-headers'
CheckOptions:
  - { key: HeaderFileExtensions,          value: "x" }
